# Hello World
This is the source code of the traditional Hello World program.

```dm
// This is a comment, and is ignored by the compiler

// This is a proc `Login()` defined on a base mob. We'll learn more about those later.
/mob/Login()
    // Statements here are executed when a mob logs into the game

    // Print text to world
    world << "Hello world"
```
